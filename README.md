# what do I do ?
I just try things with XSLT. My documents are usually TEI-friendly, but mistakes are possible. Feel free to adapt them.

# apply transformation
You can use oXygen or the xslt processor you want. Be careful to use a processor that support xslt functions used in the xsl file.

#versionning
My xsl generally use XSLT3.0 ; otherwise restrictions will be shown in the xsl file.

Have fun !
